### Day 21: Finalizers - The Deletion Blocker

Finalizers freeze resources until cleanup runs. You'll create objects with finalizers, see deletion hang, clear finalizers to unblock, inspect stuck namespaces, test PVC protection, simulate controller finalizers, handle multiple finalizers, find Terminating resources, and practice emergency cleanup.

**ENJOY!**
