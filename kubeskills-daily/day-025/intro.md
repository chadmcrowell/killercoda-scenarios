### Day 25: etcd Performance - The Cluster Heartbeat

etcd stores all cluster state. You'll check etcd pods/endpoints, query health and metrics, inspect DB size and keys, measure API latency, simulate load, compact/defrag, take snapshots, check alarms, and read metrics to understand etcd performance.

**ENJOY!**
