### Day 24: kube-proxy Modes - Service Routing Breakdown

kube-proxy programs service routing (iptables/ipvs/userspace). You'll inspect kube-proxy mode and logs, deploy a backend service, test ClusterIP/NodePort, view iptables chains, watch rule growth, simulate missing endpoints, poke session affinity and externalTrafficPolicy, and debug routing failures.

**ENJOY!**
