### Day 26: Kubelet Eviction - Resource Pressure

Kubelet evicts pods under resource pressure. You'll inspect node capacity and eviction thresholds, run pods across QoS classes, induce memory/disk pressure, observe eviction order and events, test priority effects, note PDB limits, and see deployments recover evicted pods.

**ENJOY!**
