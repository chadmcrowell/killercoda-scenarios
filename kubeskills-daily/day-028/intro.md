### Day 28: Pod Security Admission - Policy Enforcement

Pod Security Admission (PSA) enforces baseline/restricted/privileged profiles via namespace labels. You'll create namespaces with different modes, see baseline vs restricted violations, fix securityContext settings, observe warn/audit behavior, test deployments/statefulsets, and verify events for policy hits.

**ENJOY!**
