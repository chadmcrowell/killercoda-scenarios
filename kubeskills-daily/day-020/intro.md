### Day 20: Node NotReady - The Eviction Cascade

When nodes go NotReady, pods flee or cling based on tolerations. You'll deploy workloads, simulate NotReady with taints, watch default evictions, extend tolerations, make immortal pods, see StatefulSets wait, DaemonSets persist, drain nodes, and confirm deletion timestamps.

**ENJOY!**
