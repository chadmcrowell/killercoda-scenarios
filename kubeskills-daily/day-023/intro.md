### Day 23: CNI Plugin Failures - Network Isolation

CNI assigns pod IPs and wires networking. You'll inspect CNI configs and binaries, deploy baseline pods, test connectivity and DNS, simulate hostNetwork bypass, compare dnsPolicy, probe MTU, apply NetworkPolicies, watch CIDR exhaustion, and diagnose CNI errors from events and logs.

**ENJOY!**
