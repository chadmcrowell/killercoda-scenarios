### Day 27: API Server Rate Limiting - Request Throttling

The API server enforces rate limits and fairness. You'll inspect APF configs, time baseline requests, flood the API, watch for throttling and events, review FlowSchemas/PriorityLevels, test service account traffic, add a custom FlowSchema, and observe metrics for queues and inflight requests.

**ENJOY!**
