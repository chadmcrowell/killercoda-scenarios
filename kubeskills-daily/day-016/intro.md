### Day 16: RBAC Lockout - Permission Denied

RBAC is airtight until you bind the wrong thing. You'll run kubectl from a pod with a restricted ServiceAccount, hit forbidden errors, inspect permissions with auth can-i, add Roles and bindings, expand to ClusterRoles, explore aggregation, and test verb/resource-name granularity.

**ENJOY!**
