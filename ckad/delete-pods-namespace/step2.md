After deleting the pods in the `session283884` namespace, observe that new pods immediately appear. Why?

> ðŸ”¥ Kubectl Tip: The `kubectl get pods -w` command streams pod status so you can watch what happens after you delete them.

## Challenge
Delete whatever is causing the pods to regenerate so the namespace stays empty without deleting the namespace itself.
