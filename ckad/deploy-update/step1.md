A deployment resource in Kubernetes contains a replicaSet and one or more pods.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state of the deployment and underlying replicaSet.

Read more about deployments in the official Kubernetes documentation: [https://kubernetes.io/docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

A replicaSet creates the underlying pods, ensuring that the desired number of identical pods are stable and running at all times.

Create a deployment named "scaler" that uses the image `chadmcrowell/nginx-for-k8s:v1`
```bash
k -n session283884 create deploy nginx-for-k8s --image chadmcrowell/nginx-for-k8s:v1
```{{exec}}

List the deployments in the default namespace
```bash
k -n session283884 get deploy,rs,po
```{{exec}}

> **OPTIONAL:** Create a NodePort service that exposes the "scaler" deployment
```bash
k -n session283884 expose deploy nginx-for-k8s --port 80 --type NodePort
```{{exec}}
