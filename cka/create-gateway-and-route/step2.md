A **Gateway** in Kubernetes is a networking resource that controls external traffic into a cluster, supporting **HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP** protocols. It acts as a **central entry point**, replacing Ingress, and works with **GatewayClasses** and **Routes (HTTPRoute, TCPRoute, UDPRoute)** for flexible traffic management.

A **GatewayClass** defines the **implementation** of a `Gateway`, specifying which controller (e.g., NGINX, Istio, Cilium) will manage it. It acts as a **template** for Gateways, similar to how `storageClass` works for PersistentVolumes.

Install a basic Gateway resource named `my-gateway` in the default namespace. The gateway should be based on the gateway class `nginx`. You can view the `gatewayClass` with the command `kubectl get gatewayclass`.

The gateway will be listening on port 80.
