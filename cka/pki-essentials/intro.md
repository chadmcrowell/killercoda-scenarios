### Welcome !

In this fun mini-lab, you’ll:
1. Explore the **`/etc/kubernetes/pki`** directory and understand its contents.
2. See exactly how the API server depends on those files.
3. Temporarily “break” it, watch the cluster complain, and then bring it back to life.

This is a **Beginner-friendly** lab — no Kubernetes experience required.  
By the end, you’ll know why `/etc/kubernetes/pki` is the **control plane’s crown jewels**.


**ENJOY!**
