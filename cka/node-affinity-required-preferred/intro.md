### Welcome !

In this scenario, you'll practice using **node affinity** in Kubernetes to control where pods are scheduled.

Node affinity allows you to constrain which nodes a pod can be scheduled on based on node labels. There are two types:

- **Required** (`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — the pod *must* be placed on a matching node
- **Preferred** (`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) — the scheduler *tries* to place the pod on a matching node, but will still schedule it elsewhere if none match

**ENJOY!**
