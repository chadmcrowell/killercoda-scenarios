âœ… **Repository Management**
- Added and configured Helm repositories
- Updated repository indexes
- Searched for available charts

âœ… **Release Management**

- Investigated failed deployments
- Used troubleshooting commands effectively

#### Key Takeaways for CKA Exam

1. **Always verify your context** - Use `kubectl config current-context`
2. **Use dry-run for validation** - `--dry-run --debug` helps catch errors
3. **Know your rollback options** - Practice `helm history` and `helm rollback`
4. **Understand values precedence** - Command line > values file > chart defaults
5. **Master troubleshooting commands** - `helm status`, `helm get values`, `kubectl describe`

#### Next Steps
